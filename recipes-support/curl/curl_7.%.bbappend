# This modifies the recipe for curl to make it compatible with the binaries built by Microsoft
# for .Net Core and the Visual Studio remote debugger. The modification enables versioned symbols
# (CURL_OPENSSL_4). It also patches the library so it outputs a version 4 library with 
# CURL_OPENSSL_3 as the versioned symbol. 
#
# From what I can gather, the problem stems from a version of Ubuntu with a messed up curl library
# (version 4 but contains version 3 symbols). That library was used to build the Microsoft
# binaries from and now has a weird dependency. See .Net Core issue 1367
# (https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1367). jamespettigrew was the one who came up with the
# solution. 
#
# Note: this leaves the CURL_OPENSSL_4 intact so this shouldn't cause issues with other
# applications looking for version 4.
